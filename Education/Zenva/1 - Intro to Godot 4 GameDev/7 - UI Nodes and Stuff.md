### General
* When you make UI node, Godot will switch you to `2D`
* You'll see a green `X` on the top left that represents the top left corner of the screen
* You'll also see a light blue box (may need to zoom out a bit) that represents the entire screen
### <span style="color:DarkOliveGreen;">Label</span>
+ Is a type of <span style="color:DarkOliveGreen;">Control</span> node that's essentially for Godot's UI system
+ Let's you display text
+ You can have a node with a script that accepts a <span style="color:DarkOliveGreen;">Label</span>
	+ Then you can drag and drop the <span style="color:DarkOliveGreen;">Label</span> Node to the node with the following script attached
```python
# this is gdscript, but using python colors in this codeblock
@export var [LABEL_NAME] : Label
```
