There are already various behavior tree addons for Godot on the asset store, however, for my personal game none of them either worked correctly or they were UI only. I stumbled upon this amazing minimal [behaviour tree example](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/godot-behavior-tree-example) by [@viniciusgerevini](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini). I decided to fork it and create this addon from it for the following reasons:

- dedicated repo for the addon including Godot 3.x and 4.x support
- additional features such as a debug view in editor (see [#1](https://github.com/bitbrain/beehave/issues/1))
- [I am building an RPG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU-nx2tLVnk) and will have to heavily extend this addon to my needs

If you are looking for a simplistic addon without any extra fluff, Beehave is just right for you!
