# Get <span style="color:Gold;">Node Tree</span> in <span style="color:Gold;">Scene</span>

+ <span style="color:HotPink;">get_tree()</span> - built-in method that allows you to obtain a reference to the game's <span style="color:Gold;">global scene tree</span>
	+ Not an actual nature tree (had previous confusion is a <span style="color:Gold;">scene</span> where a player collides with a tree)

# Get <span style="color:Gold;">Resource</span> from <span style="color:Gold;">FileSystem</span> Window

+ <span style="color:HotPink;">preload()</span> - this function will read the file from disk and load it at compile-time. As a result, you cannot call `preload` with a variable path: you need to use a constant string
```python
# this is gdscript, but using python colors in this codeblock
var imported_resource = preload("res://robi.png")
func _ready():
    # Godot loads the resource at compile-time
    get_node("sprite").texture = imported_resource
```

+ <span style="color:HotPink;">load()</span> - just load the resource
```python
# this is gdscript, but using python colors in this codeblock
func _ready():
    # Godot loads the Resource when it reads this very line.
    var imported_resource = load("res://robi.png")
    $sprite.texture = imported_resource
```

# Pause

### What does this line of code do: <span style="color:HotPink;">await get_tree().create_timer(0.5).timeout</span>
+ It pauses the code for 0.5 seconds

# Restart / Reload a <span style="color:Gold;">Scene</span>

+ <span style="color:HotPink;">.reload_current_scene()</span> - reloads the <span style="color:Gold;">scene</span>:
	+ Reload the <span style="color:Gold;">current scene</span> by grabbing the <span style="color:Gold;">scene tree</span>:
```python
# actually gdscript, just using python md colors in this codeblock
get_tree().reload_current_scene()
```

# <span style="color:Gold;">Reference</span>s - No Hardcoded Paths

## Within a Scene
+ When in the <span style="color:Gold;">Scene</span> Window, you can
	+ Right-Click a Node
	+ Select "<span style="color:Gold;">% Access a Unique Name</span>"
		+ This will make a <span style="color:Gold;">Unique Name</span> for that node
	+ Drag & Drop that Node into you code
		+ Now you can access this variable in code in a way that's unique (instead of hard coded drag & drop)

## Outside a Scene
In Godot, use <span style="color:Gold;">UIDs (Unique Identifiers)</span> to reference objects and resources. <span style="color:Gold;">UIDs</span> are particularly useful for referring to objects that may change their path or hierarchy within the scene. Here's how you can use a <span style="color:Gold;">UID</span> to reference an object or resource:

1. **Obtain the <span style="color:Gold;">UID</span>**: 
	+ _To get the <span style="color:Gold;">UID</span> of an object or resource_, you can:
		+ **Right-click** on the target in the <span style="color:Gold;">FileSystem</span> window
		+ Select <span style="color:Gold;">Copy Unique ID</span> from the context menu.
2. **Declare a Variable with the <span style="color:Gold;">UID</span>**: 
	+ In your script, declare a variable and assign the <span style="color:Gold;">UID</span> to it. 
	+ You don't need to specify the variable type
		+ Godot will automatically infer it as <span style="color:Gold;">RID (Resource ID)</span>, which is the type used for <span style="color:Gold;">UIDs</span>.
```python
# this is gdscript, but using python colors in this codeblock
var myResourceUID = "uid://da04133isku3q"
```

3. **Load the Resource**: You can use the <span style="color:HotPink;">load()</span> function to load the resource associated with the <span style="color:Gold;">UID</span>.
```python
# this is gdscript, but using python colors in this codeblock
var myResource = load(myResourceUID)
```
Now, <span style="color:HotPink;">myResource</span> will contain the resource associated with the specified <span style="color:Gold;">UID</span>, whether it's a scene, texture, sound, or any other resource type.

4. **Use the <strong><span style="color:Gold;">Resource</span></strong>**: You can now use <span style="color:HotPink;">myResource</span> in your script. For example, if it's a <span style="color:Gold;">scene</span>, you can instance it as a <span style="color:Gold;">node</span>:
```python
# this is gdscript, but using python colors in this codeblock
var instance = myResource.instance()
```

Keep in mind that <span style="color:Gold;">UIDs</span> are particularly useful for referencing resources or nodes that might be dynamically created or moved within your project. They provide a stable reference even if the path or location of the resource changes. However, be cautious when using <span style="color:Gold;">UIDs</span>, as they won't automatically update if you change or delete the resource in the editor. It's essential to keep track of <span style="color:Gold;">UIDs</span> and ensure they remain valid in your project.

# Destroy / Remove a <span style="color:Gold;">Node</span>

+ <span style="color:HotPink;">queue_free()</span>: destroys the current node and deallocates it

+ <span style="color:HotPink;">remove_child()</span>: is a subset of <span style="color:HotPink;">queue_free()</span> and only "removes them from the world", without actually loosing their data
	* <span style="color:HotPink;">remove_child()</span> can be useful in some scenarios. For example, you might want to enter a house, but remember the state of the outside map: remove the map from the tree, add the house, but without destroying either of them. You can then swap nodes in and out.

# Random

**<strong><span style="color:HotPink;">randi_range()</span></strong> - to get random integer**
```python
# this is gdscript, but using python colors in this codeblock
star.position.x = randi_range(-280, 280)
star.position.y = randi_range(-150, 150)
```
 
**<strong><span style="color:HotPink;">randf_range()</span></strong> - to get random float**
```python
# this is gdscript, but using python colors in this codeblock
var star_size = randf_range(0.5, 1.0)
```

# <span style="color:Gold;">Resource</span> Sharing

## [In Godot 4.1](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-1-is-here/)
Until now, in GDScript, you needed to use a resource or an autoload to share data between multiple instances of the same script.

Thanks to [George Marques](https://github.com/vnen), you can now create and use static variables instead. Static variables store data on the class instead of each instance, so theyâ€™re shared between every instance of the class.

To make a variable static, add the `static` keyword in front of a variable defined at the top of your script.

# VSCode Extension
+ the `godot-tools` extension in VSCode and connect to godot's language server
	+ Default looks at port 6008
	+ Godot 4 uses 6005
		+ you need to go to extension settings for the godot extension, paste the absolute path for the godot version executable you are using, and also the port 6005
